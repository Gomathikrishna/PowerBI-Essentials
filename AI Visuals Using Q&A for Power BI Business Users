Introduction
The fastest way to get an answer from your data is to ask a question using natural language. Q&A picks the best visual based on the data. Sometimes data is defined as a certain type or category, which helps Q&A know how to display it. The Q&A feature in Power BI lets you explore your data in your own words. Q&A is available on dashboards and on reports. This article is written for business users and explains how to use the Q&A feature in a report.

Conclusion
Q&A picks the best visual based on the data. If you want a specific type of visual, tell Q&A which one to use by adding it to your question.  Sometimes data is defined as a certain type or category, which helps Q&A know how to display it. Data that is categorized as a city is more likely to be displayed as a map.
